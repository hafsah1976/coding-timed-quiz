# Challenge - 4 - Coding A Timed Quiz using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## Description

This is a timed quiz, created to test your knowledge about JavaScript programming language. I wanted to create this quiz to test my limitations. It turns out I have got many. While it was challenging to create this project from scratch, I had fun coding the timer, it was also a critical acceptance criterion. This project is a product of everything we have learned in the past weeks. When we time ourselves and do a test about any topic that we have learned, it tells us how much we have understood.
